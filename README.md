# simpeng-LLM-eval

# Project Description: 

This project is comparing the Simple English Wikipedia to a LLM summary of the regular Wikipedia article. 
The goal of this project is to focus on exploring evaluation and comparison methods. 
The evaluation will be focused on two things: 
1. How well do each adhear to the guidelines for Simple English Wikipedia?
	- The percentage of words that are in the Basic English wordlists?
	- The rate of complex syntactic structure such as subordinate clauses
2. How much and what information is lost in the summarization? 
	- The more complex of the two issues. Still brainstorming the best ways to do this
	
This project is in it's early stages
